Translations:
Deianira, wife of Hercules, was not able to cross the great river, who's name was Evenus, and asked Nessus the Centaur, who was the son of Ixionis and Nubias, for help.
He was elated to carry Deianira on his back in the river and violate her. 
when Deianira begged Hercules with her faith to come hither to intervene, he pierced Nessus with an arrow. 
that man, as he was dying, dipped the arrow in his only property, the blood of the Lerneaen Hydra, with great force, and offered it to Deianira as a love potion. 

Questions:
1. The antecedent of cui is the river. Cui is in the dative case because it connects the word river to the name the river is given
2. The form is present, infinitve, active. This is a subordinate of Deianira (First clause) because it is describing what she is not able to do and is unrelated to her relation to hercules.
3. The form is Feminine, Accusative, third person, present, passive. 
4. the form is feminine, ablative, plural. Hyginus uses ablative to express that Hercules is using the arrow to stab Nessus
5. the form is Masculine, singular, third person, present, active
6. the form is masculine, ablative, singular. Hyginus uses it to refer to the use of poison
7. the form is feminine, accusative, plural, perfect, passive.
8. the form is masculine, accusative, singular, perfect, passive
9.
