Translations:


Deianira, 
  wife of Hercules, 
*was* not able to *cross* the great river, 
    whose name *was* Evenus, 
and *asked* Nessus the Centaur, 
      who *was* the son of Ixionis and Nubias, 
for help.

He *wished* to *take away* Deianira in the river and *rape* her  

when Hercules *came hither* to *intervene*
  and Deianira *begged him with tears* for protection
He *pierced* Nessus with his arrow 

as he *was dying*, 
He *took out* his blood 
  which was that gall of the Lernean Hydra
    which he knew had great power
and *offered* it to Deianira as a love potion. 

Questions: **Please include questions so it's easy to review from this**

1. Identify the antecedent of cui, and its gender and number. Then explain what case cui is, and how it functions in the relative clause. (I.e., why is cui in this case?)

2. Identify the form of transire. Explain why you placed it in the clause you chose.
