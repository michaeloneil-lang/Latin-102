Translations:
Deianira, 
  wife of Hercules, 
  *was* not able to *cross* the great river, 
    who's name *was* Evenus, 
    and *asked* Nessus the Centaur, 
      who *was* the son of Ixionis and Nubias, 
      for help.
He *wished* to *take away* Deianira in the river 
  and *rape* her  
When Hercules came hither to intervene
  and Deianira begged him with tears for protection
    Nessus was pierced with his arrow
that man, 
  as he was dying, 
dipped the arrow in his only property, 
    the blood of the Lerneaen Hydra, 
with great force,
      and offered it to Deianira as a love potion.
