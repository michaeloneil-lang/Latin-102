B.
1. Jove is accusative, The construction is a dependant clause
2. Stercus is nominative because it is the thing that hercules, the subject of the sentence, has to clean
3. 3rd declension masculine singular accusative
4. The verbal unit is a simple sentence with a noun and a verb
5. Nominative masculine plural. antecedent is Diomedem.
6. sum, es, esse

C. Hyginus chooses to put *stercus* before *bobile* despite the dung being in the stable and not belonging to King Augaeus. In the second sentence, *taurum* is the first word, despite not being the subject of the sentence. Hyginus most likely did this to emphasize the bull's importance in the sentence.
